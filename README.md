### Description
OnlineAppointment is a web-app that allows patients to book online medical appointments. They will be able to look for a doctor in a specific speciality and then book an appointment depending on his/her availability.
Then, patients will have access to this list of their future appointments and they'll be able to manage them (edit, cancel...).

Doctors will be able to look manage their availability and their online booked appointments.
